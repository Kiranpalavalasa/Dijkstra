Path-Planning-for-a-point-robot-using-Dijkstra-Search-Algorithm
ENPM661 Project 2

Description : A point robot traverses in an obstacle map to find the goal from a starting point without colliding with the obstacles

User Dependencies:
Python 3
IDE to run the program (I used VSCode)
Libraries : numpy, time, cv2, queve
Instructions to run:
Open an IDE
Navigate to the folder where the .py file exists
Upon running the code, the user will be prompted
To enter the start coordinates
To enter the goal coordinates
Note: please have one space between the start and goal
To visualize the exploration and path, 

Code:
The code describes how to implement Dijkstra algorithm on a point robot


Output:
A plot of all explored nodes and a path depicting the shortest distance between start and goal node.
The green area depicts the explored nodes
The blue depicts the path
The black area is the obstacle
the light area around the obstacle is the clearance to completely define the configuration space
